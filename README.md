# Bike-_Sharing_Count_prediction_Deep-Learning
This project is to find prediction of bike sharing count using neural network. Here neural network is built from scratch.There are easier ways through Pytorch,tensorflow or Keras but this attempt was to have a better understanding on building neural nets from scratch.
